A replacement Yahoo prpl (protocol plugin) for Pidgin/libpurple

In 2016 Yahoo decided that they would give next-to-no notice that they were retiring their old protocol in favour of a brand new protocol that doesn't do nearly as much as the old one.  Whilst Microsoft were kind enough to give people a couple of years to plan transitions for MSN, compare that with the 2 months that Yahoo were so generous to provide.

Unfortunately I drew the short straw and ended up writing this plugin in a rush at the last minute in order to scrape something together for unfortunate Yahoo users to use.

This is not a slight change from the old protocol to a new one, instead, it's a completly different protocol with the Yahoo name slapped on it.  Thus there are several features that the new protocol doesn't have:
  * Typing notifications
  * Away/Idle statuses
  * Your old buddy list
  * Bold/italic/underline formatting
Please don't hate me because they're missing.

If you're having trouble logging in, try logging into Yahoo Mail.  For some inexplicable reason, the messenger is linked to that.
